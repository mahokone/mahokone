# 👋 Hey there, I'm Mohamed Kone

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a cybersecurity grad student in the Cyber Corps Program at the University of Tulsa, currently working toward my M.S. in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Operations.

I’m passionate about reverse engineering, embedded systems, and solving tough technical challenges that matter — especially those tied to national security. I also happen to enjoy breaking down complex systems just to figure out how they really work.

## 🧠 A bit about me

I earned my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Kennesaw State University in 2023, with a minor in French (yes, I speak a bit of that too). Now, I’m diving deep into reverse engineering, malware analysis, compiler construction, and radio frequency exploitation — through both classes and hands-on projects.

Over the past few years, I’ve interned twice with the **Department of Homeland Security**, focusing on embedded device security, LTE baseband vulnerabilities, and RF protocol research. I also spent a summer at **MIL Corporation**, helping improve security for various Systems.

## 🔧 What you’ll find here

This GitHub is where I share projects, experiments, and writeups. Some of the highlights:

### 🔬 Reverse Engineering & Security Projects
- **Pascal Compiler in C**  
  Wrote a full lexical and syntax analyzer from scratch — error detection, token parsing, symbol table... the works.

- **Binary Patching Challenges**  
  Reverse engineered and patched protected Windows x86 binaries to recover hidden flags and bypass anti-debugging checks.

- **GSM & Baseband Exploits**  
  Built tools to analyze GSM traffic, spoof mobile identities, and simulate RF attacks using SDRs and OsmocomBB.

- **Custom Wireshark Dissector**  
  Created a protocol dissector for a reverse-engineered proprietary protocol as part of a CNO project.

### 📱 Embedded + Android Work
- **Android Cell Data App**  
  Developed an Android tool that reads SIM/network info and sends SMS, used for telecom network research.

- **IoT Robot Vulnerability Testing**  
  Took apart a consumer robot, probed its firmware and hardware, and exploited weaknesses in both.

## 🚀 What's Next?

I graduate in May 2025 and I’m currently looking for **full-time roles** in cyber operations — ideally with an intelligence agency, DoD organization, or national lab. I want to work on mission-driven problems in areas like reverse engineering, offensive security, and cyber exploitation.
